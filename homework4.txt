#All the comments here are the solutions for the HomeWOrk No. 4
#While setting up the VM for this course I installed java php and apache, I used the command sudo yum -y install ht#tpd, when the process was done I run the command httpd.service start to begin the apache server.
#I also run http.service status > homework to output from the command to the homework file which is presented about
#these comments. Afterwards I wrote a simple html file from my homepage at work with some few lines on php code to #display dynamic data like date as recommended from the homework question. 
#This following links are the urls for the apache web server for homework 4
